### Frequently Asked Questions

- _Is a BusyBox required?_

> **No.** The app has its own one built-in. But having an additional BusyBox app/module installed
> won't cause any conflicts.

- _Why are some settings inactive (not toggleable)?_

> FDE.AI checks if your device supports any of the listed settings. If a setting is not supported,
> it will be disabled. This may also depend on selected AI mode & whether real-time system
> optimization is enabled or not.

- _Why does the AI set my device on performance mode while I set it on power saving?_

> The AI tunes VM for performance if the device is charging. Once you unplug the device from the
> charger, the AI will switch back to previous mode. This option is safe and will not make your
> device overheat because it tunes VM parameters only (no frequency/thermal changes).

- _The app worked fine, but the log is not getting updated for a long time. Is that OK?_

> **Yes**, because FDE.AI does various background activity only if that is really necessary basing
> on your device usage scenario. However, if you think the app got actually stuck, try to restart
> FDE.AI from the settings page or reboot your device.

- _Will FDE.AI work with X, Y or Z tweaker app?_

> Probably yes, but it is highly **NOT recommended**. Unexpected problems/conflicts may occur.
> However, if you know what you're doing, and you know whether a setting will conflict or not, you
> can use other tweakers alongside FDE.AI. However, as previously stated this is NOT RECOMMENDED
> and to be done ON YOUR OWN RISK.

- _Why are/is the CPU and/or GPU Turbo not supported?_

> Because the kernel you use doesn't provide a required info node for FDE.AI to use. However, it
> could also be your device's chipset/driver simply not supporting it. Additionally, some CPUs
> doesn't provide required tunables to operate with. 'ondemand'/'interactive'/'schedutil' or
> based on these governors should be supported by CPU Turbo. Anyhow, what you can try is changing
> the governor, kernel or simply clear the apps' data to ensure it's not just a random glitch.
> Additionally, there is legacy GPU Turbo support for certain Mali and Vivante GPU's that otherwise
> don't support the feature. It requires having constant game boost option active and works with
> supported games automatically, or can be always enabled if AI mode is set to performance.

- _How do I change my CPU/GPU governor?_

> Download a kernel manager (we recommend SmartPack but literally any is fine) and change it from
> there.

- _Can I safely close the app by swiping it away from recents?_

> Yes. There is a background service which handles all the processes. The app acts like a wrapper of
> that background service.

- _When you speak of a background service, does that mean the app will drain my battery?_

> **No**. Just no.

- _How to correctly uninstall FDE.AI?_

> Uninstall the app as usual and reboot your device. All applied settings will go back to their
> defaults. But please consider reporting your reasons for uninstalling in the support group.
> Especially if it was because of bugs or the app was not behaving as you expected.

- _Which root methods are supported by app?_

> Literally any, but Magisk is recommended.

- _What is the AI lifetime counter on the apps main page?_

> It's just a simple indicator that shows how long the AI has been active. For example, it's going
> to reset if you hit "Restart FDE.AI" or when your device reboots.

- _Why AI sometimes false-reports its mode?_

> It's not falsely reporting, it just slowly (not realtime) updates its state which usually
> requires ~40 seconds.

- _What is the "PC Optimizer" button on the info page and why is it there?_

> It's a link to the partnership (freeware) optimizer app for Windows OS. App is developed and
> maintained by different developers (not the FDE.AI team).

- _My system start to lag after FDE.AI execution. Why?_

> That should not happen. But you may try to disable **all** build.prop tweaks in settings, reboot
> device & see.

- _I have a question which this FAQ doesn't cover. Where can I find an answer?_

> Check the "Info about AI section". Also feel free to join
> our [Telegram support group](https://t.me/feralab_eng) - we'll be happy to help ðŸ˜‰

- _I found a bug/have suggestions, where can I report them?_

> Same as above - in our Telegram support group.
