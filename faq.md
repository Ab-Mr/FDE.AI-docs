## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

> Is Busybox required?

No. The app has its own one built-in.


> Why do I have issues with license verification?

Clear Google Play app's data (not cache) and reboot device. Then open Google Play and open FDE.AI. In most cases this should fix the issue.


> Why some settings are not active (not toggleable)?

FDE.AI detects if your device is capable to support any of listed settings. If setting is not supported, it will be disabled. This also may depend on selected AI mode & if real-time system optimization is enabled.


> Why AI sets device on performance mode while I set it on powersaving?

AI tunes VM for performance if device is charging. Once you unplug the device from charge, AI will switch back to previous VM mode. This option is safe and will not make device overheat.


> The app worked fine, but the log is not getting updated for a long time. Is that OK?

Yes, because FDE.AI does various background activity only if that is really necessary basing on your device usage scenario.


> Will FDE.AI work with X, Y or Z tweaker app?

Probably yes, but it is highly NOT recommended. Unexpected problems/conflicts may occur.


> Why CPU/GPUTurbo is not supported?

Because the kernel you use doesn't provide a required info node for FDE.AI to use.


> Is keeping the app running in background required?

No, there is another service, which does all job in the background. The app acts like a wrapper of that service.


> How to correctly uninstall FDE.AI?

Uninstall the app as usual and reboot your device. All applied settings will go back to their defaults.
